## 1. Abstract

The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the self-attention mechanism, has become the de facto standard for a wide range of sequence processing tasks. However, the standard "dense" attention mechanism has a computational and memory complexity of $$O(n^2)$$ with respect to the sequence length $$n$$. This quadratic scaling makes processing long sequences computationally prohibitive. Sparse attention mechanisms have emerged as a powerful solution, approximating the dense attention matrix with a sparse one, thereby reducing the complexity to $$O(n \log n)$$ or even $$O(n)$$. This document explores the mathematical foundations of sparse attention, detailing its theoretical justification and the common sparsity patterns employed.

## 2. Background: The Standard Attention Mechanism

To understand sparse attention, we must first formalize the standard (dense) attention mechanism. Given a sequence of $$n$$ input token embeddings, we project them into three matrices: Query ($$Q$$), Key ($$K$$), and Value ($$V$$), each of dimension $$\mathbb{R}^{n \times d_k}$$, where $$d_k$$ is the dimension of the keys and queries.

The attention score, which determines how much focus each token places on other tokens, is computed as:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

Let's break this down:

1.  **Similarity Scores:** The matrix product $$A = QK^T$$ computes the dot product between every query vector $$Q_i$$ and every key vector $$K_j$$. This $$n \times n$$ matrix, $$A$$, represents the unscaled similarity scores.
    $$
    A_{ij} = Q_i \cdot K_j
    $$

2.  **Scaling:** The scores are scaled by dividing by $$\sqrt{d_k}$$. This is a stabilizing factor to prevent the dot products from growing too large, which could saturate the softmax function and lead to vanishing gradients.
    $$
    \text{ScaledA}_{ij} = \frac{A_{ij}}{\sqrt{d_k}}
    $$

3.  **Softmax Normalization:** The softmax function is applied row-wise to the scaled attention scores, converting them into a probability distribution. The resulting matrix, $$P$$, contains weights where $$P_{ij}$$ is the attention weight from token $$i$$ to token $$j$$.
    $$
    P_{ij} = \frac{\exp(\text{ScaledA}_{ij})}{\sum_{k=1}^{n} \exp(\text{ScaledA}_{ik})}
    $$
    Note that $$\sum_{j=1}^{n} P_{ij} = 1$$ for any given row $$i$$.

4.  **Weighted Values:** Finally, the attention weights matrix $$P$$ is multiplied by the Value matrix $$V$$ to produce the output. Each output vector $$O_i$$ is a weighted sum of all value vectors, where the weights are the attention probabilities.
    $$
    O_i = \sum_{j=1}^{n} P_{ij} V_j
    $$

The critical bottleneck here is the computation and storage of the $$n \times n$$ attention matrix $$A$$ (and subsequently $$P$$). For a sequence of length 64k, this matrix would have over 4 billion elements.

## 3. The Theory of Sparse Attention

The core hypothesis of sparse attention is that the dense $$n \times n$$ attention matrix is redundant. Most of the attention scores are small and contribute little to the final output. The information needed to make a prediction for a given token can typically be sourced from a much smaller, localized subset of other tokens.

Sparse attention aims to compute only a subset of the $$A_{ij}$$ scores, effectively replacing the dense attention matrix $$P$$ with a sparse matrix $$P'$$.

Let $$S$$ be a set of index pairs $$(i, j)$$ that we wish to compute attention for. For a query $$Q_i$$, its attention is restricted to the set of keys $$K_j$$ where $$j \in S_i = \{j | (i, j) \in S\}$$.

The sparse attention formulation can be written as:

$$
\text{Attention'}(Q, K, V)_i = \sum_{j \in S_i} \text{softmax}_j\left(\frac{Q_i K_j^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V_j
$$

In practice, this is often implemented via masking. We set the attention scores for non-attended pairs to a large negative number (e.g., $$-\infty$$) before the softmax operation.

$$
\text{ScaledA}'_{ij} =
\begin{cases}
\frac{Q_i K_j^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} & \text{if } j \in S_i \\
-\infty & \text{if } j \notin S_i
\end{cases}
$$

Applying softmax to this masked matrix ensures that $$P'_{ij} \approx 0$$ for all $$j \notin S_i$$.

$$
P'_{ij} = \frac{\exp(\text{ScaledA}'_{ij})}{\sum_{k=1}^{n} \exp(\text{ScaledA}'_{ik})}
$$

The key challenge, and where different sparse attention models differ, is in the choice of the sparsity set $$S$$. The goal is to choose a set $$S$$ such that $$|S| \in \mathcal{O}(n \log n)$$ or $$\mathcal{O}(n)$$ while minimizing the approximation error relative to the full attention matrix.

## 4. Common Sparsity Patterns

The choice of the set $$S_i$$ for each token $$i$$ defines the "sparsity pattern." Several patterns have proven effective.

### 4.1. Sliding Window (or Local) Attention

For many types of data (text, time series, images), nearby tokens are the most relevant. Sliding window attention formalizes this by allowing each token to attend only to its neighbors within a fixed window size $$w$$.

The set of attended indices for token $$i$$ is:
$$
S_i = \{j \mid |i - j| \le w \}
$$

This is highly efficient, as each token only computes $$2w+1$$ attention scores. The complexity is $$\mathcal{O}(n \cdot w)$$, which is linear in $$n$$ if $$w$$ is constant.

### 4.2. Dilated (or Strided) Sliding Window

A limitation of the simple sliding window is that the receptive field is limited. A token can only see information from $$w$$ tokens away. To expand the receptive field without increasing computation, the window can be "dilated."

With a dilation factor $$d$$ and a window size $$w$$, the set of attended indices is:
$$
S_i = \{j \mid j = i - k \cdot d, \text{ for } k \in [-w, w] \}
$$

This allows the model to see further back in the sequence with the same computational cost as a standard sliding window.

### 4.3. Global Attention

Some tokens in a sequence have broad, summary-level importance (e.g., the `[CLS]` token in BERT). These tokens should be able to attend to all other tokens, and all other tokens should be able to attend to them.

In this pattern, we pre-select a small number of tokens to have "global" attention. Let $$G$$ be the set of global token indices.

The full set of attended indices $$S_i$$ for a token $$i$$ is a union of its local window and the global tokens:
$$
S_i = \{j \mid |i - j| \le w \} \cup G
$$

For a global token $i \in G$, its attention is dense:
$$
S_i = \{j \mid 1 \le j \le n\}
$$

Models like the Longformer combine a sliding window with global attention on a few key tokens, achieving a balance between local context and global information integration.

### 4.4. Fixed Attention

This pattern, used in models like the ETC (Extended Transformer Construction), pre-selects a fixed number of tokens that all other tokens will attend to, similar to global attention but with a different motivation. It's designed to mimic the structure of sentence parsing, where certain words act as syntactic hubs.

## 5. Conclusion

Sparse attention is a critical innovation for scaling Transformer models to long sequences. By replacing the dense, quadratic-cost attention matrix with a sparse approximation, these methods reduce computational complexity from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to a more manageable $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ or $\mathcal{O}(n)$. The choice of sparsity pattern—be it sliding window, global, or a combination—is a key architectural decision that injects a strong inductive bias into the model. The mathematical formulation, typically implemented via masking before the softmax operation, provides a robust framework for efficiently processing sequences of tens of thousands of tokens or more.

Specifically in the domain of **tick data book replay and prediction**, sparse attention offers a transformative advantage. Traditional dense attention struggles with the immense sequence lengths inherent in high-frequency trading data, where each tick represents a new data point and a "book" can span millions of events over a short period. Sparse attention mechanisms, particularly those employing **sliding windows** or localized patterns, can efficiently capture relevant short-term dependencies within the order book. Meanwhile, **global attention components** could be used to attend to critical, less frequent events like large trades or significant price movements. This allows for the construction of models capable of processing vast historical tick data streams for accurate replay simulations and, crucially, for real-time prediction of future price movements or liquidity shifts, unlocking new possibilities in algorithmic trading strategies where processing speed and contextual awareness are paramount.

This enables sparse attention to open the door for Transformers to be applied to new domains like high-resolution image processing, document summarization, and genomic analysis, alongside its significant implications for financial time series analysis.
